#Running locally


It's so simple. Clone or download the repository, open project directory and open index.html in your browser. As I mentioned above, there is not any bundler and all scripts have been injected in the HTML.

New projects are being prepared
I'll try to make this repo very useful. So, I really looking forward to your help and comments to make this better.
